Extras on top of the official Neo4j driver
##########################################

If you search *neo4j* in *PyPI*, besides a ton of abandoned or irrelevant
modules, you will find the ``neo4j`` module provided by the Neo4j company,
and the full-fledged, community developed ``py2neo``. The official module
comes with a really bare-bones API. Here we only add a thin wrapper around
it to make its usage a bit more convenient.
